Open Security Training
-----------------------

This repository contains resources and code that I wrote while going through the different classes from OpenSecurityTraining.
Credit goes primarily to Xeno Kovah (@XenoKovah) or to any other trainer that worked hard to make the classes free and open-source.
I am re-writing most of the code, even if provided by the trainers in various course materials. Therefore, some of the code here may be heavily based on the trainers' code.
